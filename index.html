    I am working on my Software Engineering degree. I like playing hanging out with friends, listening to music, and playing video games.
    I'm looking forward to learning about web design to expand my skillset and to help me narrow down what I want to do within my degree. I hope to at the very least improve my abilities for personal projects, but maybe find new passions for career choices.
    I have been a member of the church all my life. I have always felt deeply impressed by Elder Bednar's saying that no upstanding member of the church should ever make someone who isn't a member feel pushed away or outcast. My favorite scripture is Mosiah 23:21-22.
