      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This website is all about people named Johnathan. This website will provide facts, jokes, and ideas all about various people with his name. The website will treat all this information as if it belonged to a single person as a joke. We hope to amuse users with the ridiculousness of the premise and the blatant ignorance of how information is relayed to the viewer. This home page will provide an introduction to the concept of the website and make it more clear what is going on.

      <h3>Facts</h3>
      <p>
        This page will provide interesting facts about various Johnathans, it will, as with the rest of the website, deliver them as if it is a single man named Johnathan.

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        This page will provide a timeline of Johnathan’s life, with no clear order of events and stretching centuries. It will paint a confusing picture of his life and experiences in order to continue the image that he is a single person despite everything proving otherwise. This page will find users treading through an undated timeline with events that don’t paint any clear idea of when the events actually happened.
